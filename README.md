An attempt at a standard music library.

# about
The goal of this library is to provide a standard set of music-related tools
for developing music education software.  In addition to note and chord
detection from sound files and streaming input, this library aims to provide a
rich set of notation tools for discovering scales, chords, key signatures,
rhythms, tempos, etc.  A perhaps distant goal of this library is to build a
simple interface where people of all ages could learn to play an instrument in
a practical manner.  Imagine an application that sits atop a piano and
dynamically progresses through lessons based upon the skill and progress of the
student.  Imagine a paperless orchestra where the music on the stand is
dynamically highlighted and advanced as they play.  Imagine if a conductor could
write a message, change a dynamic, or delete a few bars from everybody's tablet
at once.  These are some of the "stretch" goals of this software.
